# AASX Connector

AASX Connector enables a simple publish and subscribe via REST.

AASX Server can connect to an AASX Connector and an AASX Connector can connect to another AASX Connector.
By this a tree of connectors can be built.

The REST communication is company proxy/firewall friendly. It uses only an inside-out communication.
